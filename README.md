THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
